  "LAR and Rifle platoon have slightly different missions, and are commanded by separate players. LAR may coordinate with the infantry PL, but is not under his command (and vice versa)."\

  "Note: This Soviet reconnaissance company consists of a BRDM platoon, a BTR-70 Motor Rifle Plt, and a Motor Rifle Coy HQ ."\
  "This is not perfectly accurate, as the BTR Plt would have had BMPs, and the Coy HQ a BRM-1 (a specialized recon vehicle based on the BMP)."\
  "However, BTRs are close enough for the purpose of this mission."
